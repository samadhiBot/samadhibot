diet. Except they seem to like leaves more. And sometimes they bite people.</p><p>समाधिBot: Really? So they would eat an aphid?</p><p>Miles: Yeah maybe. And look, they have tiny little antennae right there… and there… [pointing

it and stab it into a tree, and suck its blood, basically.</p><p>समाधिBot: Could they do that to a person?</p><p>Miles: No.</p><p>समाधिBot: Are you sure? I was a little freaked out by this little guy when I was taking his

Usually goose eggs are much smaller than that.</p><p>समाधिBot: It’s kind of the storybook golden egg. I was thinking about that a lot while I was
drawing it. It’s not realistic is it?</p><p>India: Mmm…</p><p>समाधिBot: But the goose is always sitting on a preposterously large golden egg.</p><p>India: Like the queen ant is always sitting there laying eggs.</p><p>समाधिBot: Have you ever drawn a goose?</p><p>India: Yes… a baby goose.</p><p>समाधिBot: Do you know what a baby goose is called?</p><p>India: … a gooseling?</p><p>समाधिBot: A <em>gosling</em>.</p><p>India: Bother…</p><p>समाधिBot: I once got chased by a goose. Ever been chased by a goose?</p><p>India: Is it scary?</p><p>समाधिBot: It is!</p><p>India: Well… they are big honking gooses…</p><p>समाधिBot: They lift their heads up high and spread their wings and hiss, and all of a sudden 
they go from being something not much different from a duck or a chicken… to this terrifying
once-was-a-dinosaur thing chasing after you.</p><p>India: But I’ve been chased by a bull before, in India.</p><p>समाधिBot: Well that’s a lot scarier. How’d you get chased by a bull?</p><p>India: Remember? We got a bit too close. That was scary.</p><p>समाधिBot: I don’t think that was a bull though.</p><p>India: What was it?</p><p>समाधिBot: It was a cow. Yeah the bulls are like a ton of rippling muscle.</p><p>India: It went like this… remember?</p><p>समाधिBot: It was doing that thing with its hoof…</p><p>India: The hoofy thing?</p><p>समाधिBot: Mm-hmm. Do you know the story of the goose laying the golden egg?</p><p>India: Jack and the Beanstalk? Uh… <em>yeah</em>. I’ve seen that show before.</p><p>समाधिBot: Is there any other story of a goose laying a golden egg, or is Jack and the Beanstalk
the only one?</p><p>India: I guess it’s the only one. There’s a Puss ’n Boots version of it, and there’s a mommy
goose that’s the size of a house, or a <em>Titanoboa</em>. Early birds had teeth, daddy.</p><p>समाधिBot: Yeah?</p><p>India: Yeah. They just had tiny little nubbin teeth. And early birds looked like penguins.</p><p>समाधिBot: <em>Really?!!</em></p><p>India: Yeah, <em>rrreally</em> big fluffy penguins.</p><p>समाधिBot: [Laughs] I thought early birds were dinosaurs.</p><p>India: They were, but they were big, fluffy looking penguins. [Makes crashing sounds like
giant dino-penguin feet stomping] And there’s this kind with flippers.</p><p>समाधिBot: I wonder if that’s how the birds survived when other dinosaurs did not. Maybe there
was some kind of… what’s the word…</p><p>India: Safety ground? A safe coral spot?</p><p>समाधिBot: An intervention! Maybe there was an intervention where they said, these other
dinosaurs, the <em>Spinosauruses</em> and whatnot, things with spikes and clubs… we’re going to
let them burn. But these big soft, fluffy penguin-like dinosaurs are just too cute to let get
wiped out.</p><p>India: Oh by the way, they were this big. [gestures]</p><p>समाधिBot: About… four feet high?</p><p>India: Mm-hmm, that’s a really big fluffy penguin. The kind with flippers is only this big.</p><p>समाधिBot: You know if we could clone one of those big fluffy dino-penguins, we could make a
<em>lot</em>  of money…</p><p>India: Yeah… they’re really fluffy… they’re this fluffy —</p><p>समाधिBot: Wow, mostly fluff?</p><p>India: Yeah, the females can get to this fluffy.</p><p>समाधिBot: Really? Were they just adorably fluffy, or were they also cold blooded killers?</p><p>India: At that time they were just vegetarians. They were just curious, they would come here,
eat a bit, go to another spot, eat a bit.</p><p>समाधिBot: That sounds nice…</p><p>India: Yeah. They didn’t really have to worry about swimming, because of all their fluff, it
just made them float.</p><p>समाधिBot: Could they fly then?</p><p>India: Nope. At that time they could kind of fly if it got really windy, then they would just
go  up in the air —</p><p>समाधिBot: Like a tumbleweed!</p><p>India: Yeah, like a tumbleweed! Anyway, how did you draw the G into the goose?</p><p>समाधिBot: I drew the letter G very lightly first, and then I looked for a goose to draw around
it. So I could see the body of a goose, mostly inside the letter G, and I could imagine the head
of the goose at the end of the top of it.</p><p>India: Those big fluffy penguins, they had <em>lonnng</em> pointy beaks. Yeah like that…</p><p>समाधिBot: Was it a specific species of big fluffy penguins, or there were lots of different
kinds?</p><p>India: It was two kinds of them. I don’t know the names of them, but I called the one that we
were first talking about the tumbleweed. The next one is kind of skinny, so I call it the naked
bird.</p><p>समाधिBot: The naked bird?</p><p>India: Yeah, it doesn’t really have many feathers. It just has big feathers it walks around in.
They’re funny.</p><p>समाधिBot: Alright… penguin interview!</p><p>India: And goose.</p><p>समाधिBot: Oh yeah, goose.</p></section><div class="share"><a class="twitter-share-button" data-text="The Origin of Geeses" data-url="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/07/13/the-origin-of-geeses/" data-via="samadhiBot" href="https://twitter.com/share">Tweet</a><div class="fb-like" data-action="like" data-href="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/07/13/the-origin-of-geeses/" data-layout="button_count" data-share="false" data-show-faces="false"></div></div></article><article><h2><a href="/2015/06/29/fishes-and-dolphins-and-sharks/">Fishes and Dolphins and Sharks</a></h2><div class="tags"><a href="/tags/india’s-notebook/">India’s notebook</a></div><div class="date">29 June 2015</div><div class="image"><a href="/2015/06/29/fishes-and-dolphins-and-sharks/"><img src="/images/posts/2015-06-29-fishes-and-dolphins-and-sharks-small.jpg" /></a></div><section><p>India: That’s a spotty dolphin.

Do you know what it is?</p><p>India: A flounder?</p><p>समाधिBot: It is a flounder! It’s a flounder that is breaching the water. You don’t see that
everyday.</p><p>India: No, you don’t see that everyday with normal flounders. I’ve seen them before but I
haven’t seen them doing that.</p><p>समाधिBot: That might be a little bit of <em>artistic license</em>, but I figured  it was better
than a flounder on the seabed with an F painted on it.</p><p>India: Mmm-hmm.</p><p>समाधिBot: Have you ever drawn a flounder?</p><p>India: Yeah, I’ve drawn one before.</p><p>समाधिBot: You have? Is it in your notebook?</p><p>India: No it was on a piece of paper…</p><p>Taj: Where is it now?</p><p>समाधिBot: Have you ever seen a flounder jump out of the water, Taj?</p><p>Taj: I don’t because I don’t know what a flounder looks like.</p><p>समाधिBot: They’re the funny, fflat fffish with both eyes on one side of their head, instead of
on either side like most fish.</p><p>Taj: Mmm…</p><p>India: There’s this giant flounder in the sea, and there’s this <em>lonnng</em> fish — you know
those really long fishes? Those flounders are so big, and they’re one of the most gentle
flounders. They’re a bit on the rough side, so they attack those long fishes a lot, because
they’re the big meat-eating flounders.</p><p>And especially in the mating season, flounders and those fishes, they don’t really like where
they’re mating if it’s near the other flounders or other fish. So they potentially fight off any
other things.</p><p>समाधिBot: Ffighting ffflounders?</p><p>India: Yeah. The way they fight is pretty funny. They get their sides, and swim swim swim —</p><p>Taj: I think Eli has a flounder. It’s pretty smooth. Pretty skinny.</p><p>समाधिBot: In his fish tank? Huh!</p><p>India: I didn’t know Eli has a fish tank.</p><p>Taj: It was a gold fish tank. But there was not a goldfish in it.</p><p>समाधिBot: Can you see the letter F in the fish?</p><p>India: Yes it’s that big green thing… there’s the F. That’s a very pretty flounder.</p><p>समाधिBot: Yeah I don’t think most flounders are ffancy ffflounders like that.</p><p>India: Most of them are grayish… yeah they’re kind of olivy colored with gray spots on them
usually.</p><p>समाधिBot: I saw some that had blue spots on them. I’m not positive those were flounders, but
there was one that stood out from the rest as being more decorative. Most of them seem like they
just try to blend in with the bottom of the ocean.</p><p>India: Especially the really small ones try to do that. Because way bigger flounders, instead of
the mommy flounders, some of those flounders like to shoo them away. So they hide because they
don’t really like being shooed around, because their fins really haven’t evolved into big
powerful fins. They’re like tiny little flippers.</p><p>So they just stay around, and if any food drops down from the sea, like if a seabird dropped a
bit of seaweed for its nest, then they just go for it. Yeah all they do is just lie around
watching birds fly over them, and big sharks and whales.</p><p>समाधिBot: Oh and they would have a good view because both their eyes are on top of their head.</p><p>India: Mmm-hmm.</p><p>समाधिBot: So it’s not so bad to be a flounder.</p><p>India: Yes.</p><p>Taj: Why does that thing look like a hand?</p><p>समाधिBot: It’s a fin. I could have just drawn a fin. That’s an F word too. But I guess a fish… a
fish has fins… a fish conveys more F-ness.</p><p>India: Yeah. You could have drawn tiny little F’s on the fins. Why did I not think of that?</p></section><div class="share"><a class="twitter-share-button" data-text="Fan Mail From Some Flounder" data-url="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/06/03/fan-mail-from-some-flounder/" data-via="samadhiBot" href="https://twitter.com/share">Tweet</a><div class="fb-like" data-action="like" data-href="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/06/03/fan-mail-from-some-flounder/" data-layout="button_count" data-share="false" data-show-faces="false"></div></div></article><div class="pagination"><span>Page 1 of 4</span><a href="/page/2/">Next page »</a></div></div></main><footer><div class="table"><div class="row"><section><h3>Recent</h3><ol><blog class="articles"><li><a href="/2015/07/21/katydid/">Katydid</a><span class="date">21 July 2015</span></li><li><a href="/2015/07/16/you-say-cicada-and-ill-say-cicada/">You Say sɪˈkeɪdə and I’ll Say sɪˈkɑːdə</a><span class="date">16 July 2015</span></li><li><a href="/2015/07/13/the-origin-of-geeses/">The Origin of Geeses</a><span class="date">13 July 2015</span></li><li><a href="/2015/06/29/fishes-and-dolphins-and-sharks/">Fishes and Dolphins and Sharks</a><span class="date">29 June 2015</span></li><li><a href="/2015/06/03/fan-mail-from-some-flounder/">Fan Mail From Some Flounder</a><span class="date">3 June 2015</span></li></blog></ol></section><section><h3>Tags</h3><ol><li><a href="/tags/india’s-notebook/">India’s notebook (15)</a></li><li><a href="/tags/miles’-files/">Miles’ files (3)</a></li><li><a href="/tags/samadhiblot/">Samadhiblot (2)</a></li></ol></section><section><h3>By Year</h3><ol><li><a href="/2015/">2015 (20)</a></li></ol></section></div></div><div class="copy">&copy; 2015 samadhiBot.
