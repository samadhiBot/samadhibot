Actually that’s my spaceship. But he’s trying to take over it. 
He’s an evil guy.</p><p>समाधिBot: He has… what’s that… a hat with a flower pot on it? He’s not a good guy.</p><p>India: No.</p><p>समाधिBot: Looks like he’s getting attacked by —</p><p>India: Yeah that’s Space Woobie.</p><p>समाधिBot: Is that a space chihuahua?</p><p>India: Yeah, that’s Woobie.</p><p>समाधिBot: Love that!</p><p>India: He thought that this thing was a space blueberry, even though it's really a space bomb, 
disguised as a blueberry.</p><p>समाधिBot: Oh my! Who’s this other person in the background?</p><p>India: That’s me. That’s my house, and someone keeps getting into it.</p><p>समाधिBot: Is that your house or your spaceship?</p><p>India: Well… this is my spaceship, that’s my house.</p><p>समाधिBot: Oh okay. And what’s going on back here? Is that part of your house?</p><p>India: Yeah, it’s trails. There’s my mailbox.</p><p>समाधिBot: Are these windows in the mountains?</p><p>India: Mm-hmm. And right now I’m running to stop this guy.</p><p>समाधिBot: And then is there… a dragon in the sky?</p><p>India: Yeah I call it the thin-nosed dragon. It kind of keeps the sun away… Yeah it’s kind of   
the guard, but today it’s not really watching.</p><p>समाधिBot: Yeah this guy got in…</p><p>India: Zahra drew a little space pond of pink. She did a nice job on that.</p><p>समाधिBot: Mm-hmm. I thought that was maybe a space potato, but it’s a space pond.</p><p>India: Yeah. There’s the door which kind of… well, I call this my Square Area.</p><p>समाधिBot: What happens in the Square Area?</p><p>India: It’s usually just… oh my Square Area… is where I do <em>things important…</em></p><p>समाधिBot: Even though there’s a bad guy who’s getting chewed on by a space chihuahua, everyone 
looks pretty happy. It seems like a pretty happy place.</p><p>India: Yes. There’s one reason why there’s this big boundary: so no one goes floating off. 
That’s the planet.</p><p>समाधिBot: Is there gravity here, or do you bounce like a trampoline when you run in this place? 
Or is it just like on Earth?</p><p>India: You just kind of bounce like you’re on a bunch of trampolines. But right now I'm on the 
ground, standing, staring at this guy. And I’m looking at Woobie also.</p><p>समाधिBot: Only Space Woobie seems kind of serious about what he’s doing.

They’re chasing him, but he doesn’t notice. Because he’s going around 
in circles. He’s pacing…</p><p>समाधिBot: What are these though?</p><p>India: They’re little stars.</p><p>समाधिBot: They’re stars chasing the moon?</p><p>India: Mmm-hmm.</p><p>Miles: But stars are millions of times bigger than any normal sized moon… usually…</p><p>समाधिBot: <em>“That's no moon.

I know one thing about it: it’s respectable 
to feed animals.</p><p>समाधिBot: Oh yeah?</p><p>India: Mmm-hmm. Well, if you’ve got an animal, and you never feed it, that’s not good to do. 
Another thing is, if you see a stranger, you’re really not a'sposed to <em>mess with it…</em></p><p>Taj: What — what did you say?</p><p>India: Well you’re not really supposed to mess with anybody if they’re a stranger.</p><p>समाधिBot: Yeah… wait… <em>mess with their mind??</em></p><p>India: No, you know, <em>talk to them.</em></p><p>समाधिBot: Oh, okay… right… um… okay. Taji, what’s in the picture? Can you see a letter ‘H’?</p><p>India: I can!</p><p>Taj: Yes, I can. It’s on the house.</p><p>समाधिBot: What color is the ‘H’?</p><p>India & Taj: White.</p><p>India: The chicken matches the color of the ‘H’. Another thing: the door looks like a pancake.</p><p>समाधिBot: <em>It’s a pancake door!</em></p><p>India: But another thing about it: the girls did a good job. Usually you’re supposed to leave 
when you see a stranger, but instead they made a meal for him —</p><p>Taj: Hey daddy you did awesome trees.</p><p>समाधिBot: Thanks, Taj! India, do you want to tell the story behind this picture? You don’t have 
to tell the whole story, but tell generally what happened. I know that there was a hut, and
there were three girls, and a creepy stranger, but I don’t know all of what happened.</p><p>India: I know one part of it. It’s kind of the end part. The girls all went to sleep, except 
the wise one, which kind of thought, <em>“Oh! I have to feed the animals!”</em> The other girls,
they just went to sleep, and old stranger dude locked them in the cellar.</p><p>समाधिBot: <em>Dear me…</em></p><p>India: But the girl who fed the animals, it’s kind of like a thing. You know, like a test? When 
you get a punishment for not doing something. Well why didn’t he tell them?</p><p>समाधिBot: Why indeed!</p><p>India: Another thing: there’s something kind of <em>suspecting</em> about the fire. Not 
everyone  who just lives in the middle of nowhere knows how to light a fire. So maybe he knew
how to make food… but the girls just kind of did it.</p><p>समाधिBot: Yeah… if you know how to make a fire, presumably you could make at least something 
simple enough to —</p><p>India: Like an egg —</p><p>समाधिBot: Like an egg. Something simple enough to feed the animals.</p><p>India: And the chicken — Taj, stop messing with the door.</p><p>समाधिBot: Are you gonna split, Taj?</p><p>Taj: Mommy said it’s lunch time.</p><p>India: The ‘H’ looks good because the chimney. In one part of the ‘H’ it goes up through the 
roof to the chimney. I thought the rest of the ‘H’ was just going to go up out of the chimney.
And this background part is like a Christmas tree —</p><p>Taj: Hey guys it’s time to have lunch.</p><p>India: Dinner.</p><p>समाधिBot: Dinner.</p><p>India: Anyway that looks like Christmas has already gone past. And he had a Christmas tree but 
then he planted it somewhere.</p><p>समाधिBot: True dat.</p><p>India: And the roof looks like hay.</p><p>समाधिBot: Yep. And he’s having a fire inside his hut with a straw roof, which I don’t think I 
would do, but I guess in Scandinavian countries they do that. Seems dodgy to me.</p></section><div class="share"><a class="twitter-share-button" data-text="Hut Hay Hen Hike" data-url="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/08/13/hut-hay-hen-hike/" data-via="samadhiBot" href="https://twitter.com/share">Tweet</a><div class="fb-like" data-action="like" data-href="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/08/13/hut-hay-hen-hike/" data-layout="button_count" data-share="false" data-show-faces="false"></div></div></article><article><h2><a href="/2015/08/03/small-eyed-sphinx-moth/">Small Eyed Sphinx Moth</a></h2><div class="tags"><a href="/tags/miles’-files/">Miles’ files</a></div><div class="date">3 August 2015</div><div class="image"><a href="/2015/08/03/small-eyed-sphinx-moth/"><img src="/images/posts/2015-08-03-small-eyed-sphinx-moth-small.jpg" /></a></div><section><p>समाधिBot: What is it?</p><p>Miles: Small eyed sphinx.</p><p>समाधिBot: And where did you find it?</p><p>India: Back porch?

beyond its top wings.</p><p>समाधिBot: Do these fly well?</p><p>Miles: Yes, almost all sphinx moths are really strong flyers.</p><p>समाधिBot: Its body looks so big in comparison to its wings, it seems like it would have a hard
