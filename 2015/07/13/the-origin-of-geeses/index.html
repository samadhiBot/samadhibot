Usually goose eggs are much smaller than that.</p><p>समाधिBot: It’s kind of the storybook golden egg. I was thinking about that a lot while I was
drawing it. It’s not realistic is it?</p><p>India: Mmm…</p><p>समाधिBot: But the goose is always sitting on a preposterously large golden egg.</p><p>India: Like the queen ant is always sitting there laying eggs.</p><p>समाधिBot: Have you ever drawn a goose?</p><p>India: Yes… a baby goose.</p><p>समाधिBot: Do you know what a baby goose is called?</p><p>India: … a gooseling?</p><p>समाधिBot: A <em>gosling</em>.</p><p>India: Bother…</p><p>समाधिBot: I once got chased by a goose. Ever been chased by a goose?</p><p>India: Is it scary?</p><p>समाधिBot: It is!</p><p>India: Well… they are big honking gooses…</p><p>समाधिBot: They lift their heads up high and spread their wings and hiss, and all of a sudden 
they go from being something not much different from a duck or a chicken… to this terrifying
once-was-a-dinosaur thing chasing after you.</p><p>India: But I’ve been chased by a bull before, in India.</p><p>समाधिBot: Well that’s a lot scarier. How’d you get chased by a bull?</p><p>India: Remember? We got a bit too close. That was scary.</p><p>समाधिBot: I don’t think that was a bull though.</p><p>India: What was it?</p><p>समाधिBot: It was a cow. Yeah the bulls are like a ton of rippling muscle.</p><p>India: It went like this… remember?</p><p>समाधिBot: It was doing that thing with its hoof…</p><p>India: The hoofy thing?</p><p>समाधिBot: Mm-hmm. Do you know the story of the goose laying the golden egg?</p><p>India: Jack and the Beanstalk? Uh… <em>yeah</em>. I’ve seen that show before.</p><p>समाधिBot: Is there any other story of a goose laying a golden egg, or is Jack and the Beanstalk
the only one?</p><p>India: I guess it’s the only one. There’s a Puss ’n Boots version of it, and there’s a mommy
goose that’s the size of a house, or a <em>Titanoboa</em>. Early birds had teeth, daddy.</p><p>समाधिBot: Yeah?</p><p>India: Yeah. They just had tiny little nubbin teeth. And early birds looked like penguins.</p><p>समाधिBot: <em>Really?!!</em></p><p>India: Yeah, <em>rrreally</em> big fluffy penguins.</p><p>समाधिBot: [Laughs] I thought early birds were dinosaurs.</p><p>India: They were, but they were big, fluffy looking penguins. [Makes crashing sounds like
giant dino-penguin feet stomping] And there’s this kind with flippers.</p><p>समाधिBot: I wonder if that’s how the birds survived when other dinosaurs did not. Maybe there
was some kind of… what’s the word…</p><p>India: Safety ground? A safe coral spot?</p><p>समाधिBot: An intervention! Maybe there was an intervention where they said, these other
dinosaurs, the <em>Spinosauruses</em> and whatnot, things with spikes and clubs… we’re going to
let them burn. But these big soft, fluffy penguin-like dinosaurs are just too cute to let get
wiped out.</p><p>India: Oh by the way, they were this big. [gestures]</p><p>समाधिBot: About… four feet high?</p><p>India: Mm-hmm, that’s a really big fluffy penguin. The kind with flippers is only this big.</p><p>समाधिBot: You know if we could clone one of those big fluffy dino-penguins, we could make a
<em>lot</em>  of money…</p><p>India: Yeah… they’re really fluffy… they’re this fluffy —</p><p>समाधिBot: Wow, mostly fluff?</p><p>India: Yeah, the females can get to this fluffy.</p><p>समाधिBot: Really? Were they just adorably fluffy, or were they also cold blooded killers?</p><p>India: At that time they were just vegetarians. They were just curious, they would come here,
eat a bit, go to another spot, eat a bit.</p><p>समाधिBot: That sounds nice…</p><p>India: Yeah. They didn’t really have to worry about swimming, because of all their fluff, it
just made them float.</p><p>समाधिBot: Could they fly then?</p><p>India: Nope. At that time they could kind of fly if it got really windy, then they would just
go  up in the air —</p><p>समाधिBot: Like a tumbleweed!</p><p>India: Yeah, like a tumbleweed! Anyway, how did you draw the G into the goose?</p><p>समाधिBot: I drew the letter G very lightly first, and then I looked for a goose to draw around
it. So I could see the body of a goose, mostly inside the letter G, and I could imagine the head
of the goose at the end of the top of it.</p><p>India: Those big fluffy penguins, they had <em>lonnng</em> pointy beaks. Yeah like that…</p><p>समाधिBot: Was it a specific species of big fluffy penguins, or there were lots of different
kinds?</p><p>India: It was two kinds of them. I don’t know the names of them, but I called the one that we
were first talking about the tumbleweed. The next one is kind of skinny, so I call it the naked
bird.</p><p>समाधिBot: The naked bird?</p><p>India: Yeah, it doesn’t really have many feathers. It just has big feathers it walks around in.
They’re funny.</p><p>समाधिBot: Alright… penguin interview!</p><p>India: And goose.</p><p>समाधिBot: Oh yeah, goose.</p></section><div class="share"><a class="twitter-share-button" data-text="The Origin of Geeses" data-url="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/07/13/the-origin-of-geeses/" data-via="samadhiBot" href="https://twitter.com/share">Tweet</a><div class="fb-like" data-action="like" data-href="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/07/13/the-origin-of-geeses/" data-layout="button_count" data-share="false" data-show-faces="false"></div></div></article></main><footer><div class="table"><div class="row"><section><h3>Recent</h3><ol><blog class="articles"><li><a href="/2015/08/13/hut-hay-hen-hike/">Hut Hay Hen Hike</a><span class="date">13 August 2015</span></li><li><a href="/2015/08/03/small-eyed-sphinx-moth/">Small Eyed Sphinx Moth</a><span class="date">3 August 2015</span></li><li><a href="/2015/07/29/what-is-not-to-like-about-wasps-mosquitos-and-yellow-jackets/">What is not to like about Wasps, Mosquitos and Yellow Jackets?</a><span class="date">29 July 2015</span></li><li><a href="/2015/07/21/katydid/">Katydid</a><span class="date">21 July 2015</span></li><li><a href="/2015/07/16/you-say-cicada-and-ill-say-cicada/">You Say sɪˈkeɪdə and I’ll Say sɪˈkɑːdə</a><span class="date">16 July 2015</span></li></blog></ol></section><section><h3>Tags</h3><ol><li><a href="/tags/india’s-notebook/">India’s notebook (16)</a></li><li><a href="/tags/miles’-files/">Miles’ files (4)</a></li><li><a href="/tags/samadhiblot/">Samadhiblot (3)</a></li></ol></section><section><h3>By Year</h3><ol><li><a href="/2015/">2015 (23)</a></li></ol></section></div></div><div class="copy">&copy; 2015 samadhiBot.
