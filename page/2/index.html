walnut trees around it. Let me get the moth book. [Leaves room]</p><p>India: Do you think it just hatched out of its little cocoon? I miss that little peeper…
[Does a little beat boxing] Yay! Miles came back!</p><p>Miles: A twin-spotted sphinx.</p><p>India: It’s probably that…</p><p>Miles: No that’s a small eyed sphinx.</p><p>India: Thought it was a giant sphinx. Is it a giant sphinx?</p><p>Miles: No giant sphinx is… they’re much bigger. They look sort of like a rustic sphinx except…
or they look like a tomato hornworm with yellow underwings, except about that big… It’s
probably either from a poplar, apple or birch, I think. One of those trees. Probably poplar.</p><p>समाधिBot: Any salient points about the twin-spotted sphinx moth?</p><p>India: Uh yeah, I got a point. Why did it poo on our white paper?</p><p>समाधिBot: That’s a question, not a point. Why is it shaking its wings?</p><p>Miles: All moths do that if they haven’t flown in a long time.</p><p>समाधिBot: They’re warming up?</p><p>Miles: Yeah. Especially tent caterpillar moths. They have such small wings that they can’t fly
without warming up.</p><p>समाधिBot: Really? I did not know that about moths. So they really rely on their camouflage,
‘cos they can’t just fly away if they need to.</p><p>Miles: They can, but if they haven’t flown for a day they have to warm up their wings.</p><p>समाधिBot: Why would they not fly for a day?</p><p>Miles: I know… some don’t. There was that catalpa sphinx that we saw, and it had to warm its
wings up before flying. Probably been sitting there for about one or two days.</p><p>समाधिBot: Well it makes it handy for moth analysis…</p><p>India: Remember how Miles found an imperial moth at a gas station?</p><p>Miles: Mmm-hmm, and there was a royal walnut moth —</p><p>Miles and India: [together, musically] <em>winnng</em></p><p>Miles: — and a dead Polyphemus moth, another squished imperial moth, and some cecropia moths…</p><p>समाधिBot: All at one gas station?</p><p>India: Gas station people don’t really like moths around. Even the most exciting and beautiful
ones.</p><p>समाधिBot: What do gas station people like around?</p><p>India: They just like around traffic and honks. Daddy did you know that atlas moths have to
flap their wings so much time before flying because they have such a big body? So they have to
go like this [flaps and pants] … or like this [flaps and pants again]. This is how the boys fly
[flaps and pants seriously]. This is how the girls fly [flaps and pants gracefully].</p><p>समाधिBot: Ah very gracefully the girls…</p><p>India: The boys fly very serious-like.</p><p>Miles: No they actually don’t have a really big body. They should probably have a royal walnut
moth sized body, but their body is about half that size. But they have really big wings. So
they’re big muscly guys.</p><p>समाधिBot: Yeah? I wanna be a big muscly guy.</p><p>Miles: There was once a picture of one scaring away a crow.</p><p>समाधिBot: Really? Atlas moth?</p><p>Miles: Yeah, and it was a really big one about that big.</p><p>India: How big is the biggest butterfly ever?</p><p>Miles: Mmm, it’s the same size, exactly the same size, except the caterpillar is bigger.</p><p>India: Oohhh-kay…</p><p>समाधिBot: What’s the biggest one called?</p><p>Miles: Mmm, Queen Alexandra’s birdwing, I think.</p><p>समाधिBot: Queen Alexander’s bird wing?</p><p>Miles: Yeah a weird name.</p><p>India: Queeland Aglandis bird fling?</p><p>समाधिBot: Who was queen… Queen of Atlantis bird wing? Who was Queen Alexander?</p><p>Miles: I don’t know.</p></section><div class="share"><a class="twitter-share-button" data-text="Twin-spotted Sphinx Moth" data-url="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/05/23/twin-spotted-sphinx-moth/" data-via="samadhiBot" href="https://twitter.com/share">Tweet</a><div class="fb-like" data-action="like" data-href="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/05/23/twin-spotted-sphinx-moth/" data-layout="button_count" data-share="false" data-show-faces="false"></div></div></article><article><h2><a href="/2015/05/22/sometimes-they-hang-around-the-moon/">Sometimes They Hang Around the Moon</a></h2><div class="tags"><a href="/tags/india’s-notebook/">India’s notebook</a></div><div class="date">22 May 2015</div><div class="image"><a href="/2015/05/22/sometimes-they-hang-around-the-moon/"><img src="/images/posts/2015-05-22-sometimes-they-hang-around-the-moon-small.jpg" /></a></div><section><p>India: This is a luna moth.</p><p>समाधिBot: And a leaf.</p><p>India: Yeah, it’s a leaf. It’s on the forest floor.</p><p>समाधिBot: Do their heads look like that?</p><p>India: Yes, they have big round heads with these small, fluffy antennas.</p><p>समाधिBot: How big does a luna moth get?</p><p>India: Well… it usually depends on which is a female and which is a male, because the female
usually gets bigger, but the male, he stays smaller, because he doesn’t really lay eggs, so
they just stay put.</p><p>समाधिBot: They just hang around?</p><p>India: Yeah they just don’t really do the laying eggs part. They just —</p><p>Taj: The boys do the hunting.</p><p>India: <em>Nnnoo,</em> boy luna moths don’t hunt, they just —</p><p>Taj: The boy eagles do the hunting.</p><p>India: We’re not talking about eagles in this interview, Taj. But anyway. The boys usually come
out in a light when nobody’s around because they’re really shy moths. It’s really uncommon to
see them if they’re around while people are around, because they just don’t really like being
around when somebody else is around.</p><p>समाधिBot: When people are around?</p><p>India: Yeah they mostly like a bit more quiet, so they go somewhere else.</p><p>समाधिBot: Where do they go for quiet?</p><p>India: Well they go somewhere where there’s lights on, or sometimes they hang around the moon,
on a big tree or something. But if somebody left their light on, and there’s nobody around, the
luna moths, they just fly over to sit on the windowsill, unless somebody scares them. And if
you go outside and look, you’ll see that it’s flown away, leaving a little bit of green wing
dust on the window.</p></section><div class="share"><a class="twitter-share-button" data-text="Sometimes They Hang Around the Moon" data-url="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/05/22/sometimes-they-hang-around-the-moon/" data-via="samadhiBot" href="https://twitter.com/share">Tweet</a><div class="fb-like" data-action="like" data-href="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/05/22/sometimes-they-hang-around-the-moon/" data-layout="button_count" data-share="false" data-show-faces="false"></div></div></article><article><h2><a href="/2015/05/20/just-walking-under-a-giant-flower/">Just Walking Under a Giant Flower</a></h2><div class="tags"><a href="/tags/india’s-notebook/">India’s notebook</a></div><div class="date">20 May 2015</div><div class="image"><a href="/2015/05/20/just-walking-under-a-giant-flower/"><img src="/images/posts/2015-05-20-just-walking-under-a-giant-flower-small.jpg" /></a></div><section><p>India: Thisss… is a picture of Miles just walking under a giant flower, because he’s been
