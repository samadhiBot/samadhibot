Usually goose eggs are much smaller than that.</p><p>समाधिBot: It’s kind of the storybook golden egg. I was thinking about that a lot while I was
drawing it. It’s not realistic is it?</p><p>India: Mmm…</p><p>समाधिBot: But the goose is always sitting on a preposterously large golden egg.</p><p>India: Like the queen ant is always sitting there laying eggs.</p><p>समाधिBot: Have you ever drawn a goose?</p><p>India: Yes… a baby goose.</p><p>समाधिBot: Do you know what a baby goose is called?</p><p>India: … a gooseling?</p><p>समाधिBot: A <em>gosling</em>.</p><p>India: Bother…</p><p>समाधिBot: I once got chased by a goose. Ever been chased by a goose?</p><p>India: Is it scary?</p><p>समाधिBot: It is!</p><p>India: Well… they are big honking gooses…</p><p>समाधिBot: They lift their heads up high and spread their wings and hiss, and all of a sudden 
they go from being something not much different from a duck or a chicken… to this terrifying
once-was-a-dinosaur thing chasing after you.</p><p>India: But I’ve been chased by a bull before, in India.</p><p>समाधिBot: Well that’s a lot scarier. How’d you get chased by a bull?</p><p>India: Remember? We got a bit too close. That was scary.</p><p>समाधिBot: I don’t think that was a bull though.</p><p>India: What was it?</p><p>समाधिBot: It was a cow. Yeah the bulls are like a ton of rippling muscle.</p><p>India: It went like this… remember?</p><p>समाधिBot: It was doing that thing with its hoof…</p><p>India: The hoofy thing?</p><p>समाधिBot: Mm-hmm. Do you know the story of the goose laying the golden egg?</p><p>India: Jack and the Beanstalk? Uh… <em>yeah</em>. I’ve seen that show before.</p><p>समाधिBot: Is there any other story of a goose laying a golden egg, or is Jack and the Beanstalk
the only one?</p><p>India: I guess it’s the only one. There’s a Puss ’n Boots version of it, and there’s a mommy
goose that’s the size of a house, or a <em>Titanoboa</em>. Early birds had teeth, daddy.</p><p>समाधिBot: Yeah?</p><p>India: Yeah. They just had tiny little nubbin teeth. And early birds looked like penguins.</p><p>समाधिBot: <em>Really?!!</em></p><p>India: Yeah, <em>rrreally</em> big fluffy penguins.</p><p>समाधिBot: [Laughs] I thought early birds were dinosaurs.</p><p>India: They were, but they were big, fluffy looking penguins. [Makes crashing sounds like
giant dino-penguin feet stomping] And there’s this kind with flippers.</p><p>समाधिBot: I wonder if that’s how the birds survived when other dinosaurs did not. Maybe there
was some kind of… what’s the word…</p><p>India: Safety ground? A safe coral spot?</p><p>समाधिBot: An intervention! Maybe there was an intervention where they said, these other
dinosaurs, the <em>Spinosauruses</em> and whatnot, things with spikes and clubs… we’re going to
let them burn. But these big soft, fluffy penguin-like dinosaurs are just too cute to let get
wiped out.</p><p>India: Oh by the way, they were this big. [gestures]</p><p>समाधिBot: About… four feet high?</p><p>India: Mm-hmm, that’s a really big fluffy penguin. The kind with flippers is only this big.</p><p>समाधिBot: You know if we could clone one of those big fluffy dino-penguins, we could make a
<em>lot</em>  of money…</p><p>India: Yeah… they’re really fluffy… they’re this fluffy —</p><p>समाधिBot: Wow, mostly fluff?</p><p>India: Yeah, the females can get to this fluffy.</p><p>समाधिBot: Really? Were they just adorably fluffy, or were they also cold blooded killers?</p><p>India: At that time they were just vegetarians. They were just curious, they would come here,
eat a bit, go to another spot, eat a bit.</p><p>समाधिBot: That sounds nice…</p><p>India: Yeah. They didn’t really have to worry about swimming, because of all their fluff, it
just made them float.</p><p>समाधिBot: Could they fly then?</p><p>India: Nope. At that time they could kind of fly if it got really windy, then they would just
go  up in the air —</p><p>समाधिBot: Like a tumbleweed!</p><p>India: Yeah, like a tumbleweed! Anyway, how did you draw the G into the goose?</p><p>समाधिBot: I drew the letter G very lightly first, and then I looked for a goose to draw around
it. So I could see the body of a goose, mostly inside the letter G, and I could imagine the head
of the goose at the end of the top of it.</p><p>India: Those big fluffy penguins, they had <em>lonnng</em> pointy beaks. Yeah like that…</p><p>समाधिBot: Was it a specific species of big fluffy penguins, or there were lots of different
kinds?</p><p>India: It was two kinds of them. I don’t know the names of them, but I called the one that we
were first talking about the tumbleweed. The next one is kind of skinny, so I call it the naked
bird.</p><p>समाधिBot: The naked bird?</p><p>India: Yeah, it doesn’t really have many feathers. It just has big feathers it walks around in.
They’re funny.</p><p>समाधिBot: Alright… penguin interview!</p><p>India: And goose.</p><p>समाधिBot: Oh yeah, goose.</p></section><div class="share"><a class="twitter-share-button" data-text="The Origin of Geeses" data-url="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/07/13/the-origin-of-geeses/" data-via="samadhiBot" href="https://twitter.com/share">Tweet</a><div class="fb-like" data-action="like" data-href="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/07/13/the-origin-of-geeses/" data-layout="button_count" data-share="false" data-show-faces="false"></div></div></article><article><h2><a href="/2015/06/29/fishes-and-dolphins-and-sharks/">Fishes and Dolphins and Sharks</a></h2><div class="tags"><a href="/tags/india’s-notebook/">India’s notebook</a></div><div class="date">29 June 2015</div><div class="image"><a href="/2015/06/29/fishes-and-dolphins-and-sharks/"><img src="/images/posts/2015-06-29-fishes-and-dolphins-and-sharks-small.jpg" /></a></div><section><p>India: That’s a spotty dolphin.

Do you know what it is?</p><p>India: A flounder?</p><p>समाधिBot: It is a flounder! It’s a flounder that is breaching the water. You don’t see that
everyday.</p><p>India: No, you don’t see that everyday with normal flounders. I’ve seen them before but I
haven’t seen them doing that.</p><p>समाधिBot: That might be a little bit of <em>artistic license</em>, but I figured  it was better
than a flounder on the seabed with an F painted on it.</p><p>India: Mmm-hmm.</p><p>समाधिBot: Have you ever drawn a flounder?</p><p>India: Yeah, I’ve drawn one before.</p><p>समाधिBot: You have? Is it in your notebook?</p><p>India: No it was on a piece of paper…</p><p>Taj: Where is it now?</p><p>समाधिBot: Have you ever seen a flounder jump out of the water, Taj?</p><p>Taj: I don’t because I don’t know what a flounder looks like.</p><p>समाधिBot: They’re the funny, fflat fffish with both eyes on one side of their head, instead of
on either side like most fish.</p><p>Taj: Mmm…</p><p>India: There’s this giant flounder in the sea, and there’s this <em>lonnng</em> fish — you know
those really long fishes? Those flounders are so big, and they’re one of the most gentle
flounders. They’re a bit on the rough side, so they attack those long fishes a lot, because
they’re the big meat-eating flounders.</p><p>And especially in the mating season, flounders and those fishes, they don’t really like where
they’re mating if it’s near the other flounders or other fish. So they potentially fight off any
other things.</p><p>समाधिBot: Ffighting ffflounders?</p><p>India: Yeah. The way they fight is pretty funny. They get their sides, and swim swim swim —</p><p>Taj: I think Eli has a flounder. It’s pretty smooth. Pretty skinny.</p><p>समाधिBot: In his fish tank? Huh!</p><p>India: I didn’t know Eli has a fish tank.</p><p>Taj: It was a gold fish tank. But there was not a goldfish in it.</p><p>समाधिBot: Can you see the letter F in the fish?</p><p>India: Yes it’s that big green thing… there’s the F. That’s a very pretty flounder.</p><p>समाधिBot: Yeah I don’t think most flounders are ffancy ffflounders like that.</p><p>India: Most of them are grayish… yeah they’re kind of olivy colored with gray spots on them
usually.</p><p>समाधिBot: I saw some that had blue spots on them. I’m not positive those were flounders, but
there was one that stood out from the rest as being more decorative. Most of them seem like they
just try to blend in with the bottom of the ocean.</p><p>India: Especially the really small ones try to do that. Because way bigger flounders, instead of
the mommy flounders, some of those flounders like to shoo them away. So they hide because they
don’t really like being shooed around, because their fins really haven’t evolved into big
powerful fins. They’re like tiny little flippers.</p><p>So they just stay around, and if any food drops down from the sea, like if a seabird dropped a
bit of seaweed for its nest, then they just go for it. Yeah all they do is just lie around
watching birds fly over them, and big sharks and whales.</p><p>समाधिBot: Oh and they would have a good view because both their eyes are on top of their head.</p><p>India: Mmm-hmm.</p><p>समाधिBot: So it’s not so bad to be a flounder.</p><p>India: Yes.</p><p>Taj: Why does that thing look like a hand?</p><p>समाधिBot: It’s a fin. I could have just drawn a fin. That’s an F word too. But I guess a fish… a
fish has fins… a fish conveys more F-ness.</p><p>India: Yeah. You could have drawn tiny little F’s on the fins. Why did I not think of that?</p></section><div class="share"><a class="twitter-share-button" data-text="Fan Mail From Some Flounder" data-url="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/06/03/fan-mail-from-some-flounder/" data-via="samadhiBot" href="https://twitter.com/share">Tweet</a><div class="fb-like" data-action="like" data-href="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/06/03/fan-mail-from-some-flounder/" data-layout="button_count" data-share="false" data-show-faces="false"></div></div></article><article><h2><a href="/2015/06/01/thats-slash-cow-slash-dragon/">That’s Slash-Cow Slash-Dragon</a></h2><div class="tags"><a href="/tags/india’s-notebook/">India’s notebook</a></div><div class="date">1 June 2015</div><div class="image"><a href="/2015/06/01/thats-slash-cow-slash-dragon/"><img src="/images/posts/2015-06-01-thats-slash-cow-slash-dragon-small.jpg" /></a></div><section><p>India: That’s slash-cow slash-dragon, it’s kind of half bull, half dragon.</p><p>Taj: What else half?</p><p>India: That’s the only thing half of it. And there’s one really funny thing about it:
guess what.</p><p>समाधिBot: What?</p><p>India: You may think that it’s a meat eater, but it’s a vegetarian!</p><p>समाधिBot: <em>Whaaat?</em></p><p>India: And the only meat that it eats is crabs. And it likes to eat their clippers ‘cos it
thinks that it will develop clippers coming out of its tummy. Yeah so it can clip things and put
‘em in its mouth, because they’re very hungry things. It lives mostly around in the desert.</p><p>समाधिBot: Is it one of those people that <em>says</em> it’s a vegetarian but eats crabs, fish,
maybe a little bit of chicken once in a while? I’ve met people like that —</p><p>Taj: [Exasperated] It’s taking long!</p><p>India: We just started Taj.</p><p>समाधिBot: What about the glowing forehead?</p><p>India: Oh. That’s a glowing improvised fire thingy, so if it’s in danger it can make a fire
ring around it, and fall into a well if it’s done it at the right spot. Because they sometimes
eat each other since they live in the desert and there’s not really much food for them. So they
like to try and eat each other.</p><p>And there’s one thing: if it’s totally surrounded in a ring of fire and they’re all aiming their
heads, and it ducks, then they all head-bump each other. That’s the funny thing about them:
they’re very absent-minded.</p><p>समाधिBot: Can they fly?</p><p>India: Yes they fly —</p><p>Taj: Awesome?</p><p>India: Yeah but they don’t really fly well because their tummy drags them places, and they have
to mostly swing their tail that way, or swing it that way if they want to go places.</p><p>Taj: How do you go straight? And backwards?</p><p>India: But if they’re not watching then they accidentally get their horns stuck. They try and
disguise theirselves as a… they try and make it look like a flying zebra ear. They try and do
that so the others just get so hungry that they bite ahold of it, and  their mouth gets stabbed.
That’s one defense that they use. But they’re very nice.</p></section><div class="share"><a class="twitter-share-button" data-text="That’s Slash-Cow Slash-Dragon" data-url="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/06/01/thats-slash-cow-slash-dragon/" data-via="samadhiBot" href="https://twitter.com/share">Tweet</a><div class="fb-like" data-action="like" data-href="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/06/01/thats-slash-cow-slash-dragon/" data-layout="button_count" data-share="false" data-show-faces="false"></div></div></article><article><h2><a href="/2015/05/29/i-call-it-the-bewilder-frog/">I Call It the Bewilder-Frog</a></h2><div class="tags"><a href="/tags/india’s-notebook/">India’s notebook</a></div><div class="date">29 May 2015</div><div class="image"><a href="/2015/05/29/i-call-it-the-bewilder-frog/"><img src="/images/posts/2015-05-29-i-call-it-the-bewilder-frog-small.jpg" /></a></div><section><p>समाधिBot: What would you call this new piece of artwork?</p><p>India: Well… it’s a new made up thing I made. I call it the bewilder-frog.</p><p>समाधिBot: The bewilder-frog? I like that name!</p><p>India: It wears a mask because it tries to hide its face, because its face doesn’t really look
like a normal frog, so it wears a mask all the time.</p><p>समाधिBot: Is its face bewildering? Or is it a total mystery??</p><p>India: Well… its face is kind of like grey black white colored.</p><p>समाधिBot: Oh… not a normal frog face at all.</p><p>India: Uh-uh. And usually they’re covered with scratches and bite marks, because when something
sees it, it automatically gets so frightened and mad at the same time, even though it didn’t do
anything. So it just bites, scratches, and does whatever it wants.</p><p>समाधिBot: I’ve seen animals act like that. Tell me about the cape. Why does he wear a cape?</p><p>India: Well, they don’t really like being on the ground for that long, because they just don’t
really like any animals around. And so they climb up a tree, jump, and they kind of glide for a
moment, and then they land on another tree.</p><p>समाधिBot: Does the cape help them glide?</p><p>India: Yeah, it kind of helps them glide, because they eat like once a month or once a week.
They’re not really that much weighted. They’re light weighted.</p></section><div class="image"><img src="/images/posts/2015-05-29-i-call-it-the-bewilder-frog-2-small.jpg" /></div><section><p>समाधिBot: Now tell me about the mask.</p><p>India: Oh the mask. The mask was made like three days ago, but it took a long time. It took the
whole day until the evening.</p><p>समाधिBot: Really?</p><p>India: Yeah. That was the first mask I made. Then I didn’t think it would look good, so I
switched to making another mask, but it got torn because Zahra was messing with it, and it
didn’t really work out right. So I picked that one up and I thought, “This might work out!” So I
just kept cutting until it was all done.</p><p>Then I <em>did</em> like the drawings. The black things sticking down from its lower jaw,
they’re vangs, and there’s vangs at the top. They use vangs for poisonous snakes, ‘cos snakes
don’t really like to interact with other vanged creatures or snakes.</p><p>It has three eyes because it can see better, hunt better, and it’s so it can see up and down.
So if there’s a big bird swooping down, it can look up. And the two extra eyes, they’re for
looking sideways and forwards.</p><p>समाधिBot: That one at the top, in the middle, in mystical traditions that can represent spiritual
vision, or inner vision. Does this frog have that?</p><p>India: Yeah. The reason why it has three layers it’s because it can close in its eyes at the
thing that’s right above it so it can see better.</p><p>And there’s that nose thingy because it likes to pretend it’s a big cat. That’s the reason why
it has a mask on its face, it pretends to be a three-eyed lion. It tries to pretend it’s a lion.
Everyone knows that it’s bad to mess with a male lion.</p></section><div class="share"><a class="twitter-share-button" data-text="I Call It the Bewilder-Frog" data-url="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/05/29/i-call-it-the-bewilder-frog/" data-via="samadhiBot" href="https://twitter.com/share">Tweet</a><div class="fb-like" data-action="like" data-href="http://one.samadhibot.com/2015/05/29/i-call-it-the-bewilder-frog/" data-layout="button_count" data-share="false" data-show-faces="false"></div></div></article><div class="pagination"><a href="/">« Previous page</a><span>Page 2 of 5</span><a href="/page/3/">Next page »</a></div></div></main><footer><div class="table"><div class="row"><section><h3>Recent</h3><ol><blog class="articles"><li><a href="/2015/08/13/hut-hay-hen-hike/">Hut Hay Hen Hike</a><span class="date">13 August 2015</span></li><li><a href="/2015/08/03/small-eyed-sphinx-moth/">Small Eyed Sphinx Moth</a><span class="date">3 August 2015</span></li><li><a href="/2015/07/29/what-is-not-to-like-about-wasps-mosquitos-and-yellow-jackets/">What is not to like about Wasps, Mosquitos and Yellow Jackets?</a><span class="date">29 July 2015</span></li><li><a href="/2015/07/21/katydid/">Katydid</a><span class="date">21 July 2015</span></li><li><a href="/2015/07/16/you-say-cicada-and-ill-say-cicada/">You Say sɪˈkeɪdə and I’ll Say sɪˈkɑːdə</a><span class="date">16 July 2015</span></li></blog></ol></section><section><h3>Tags</h3><ol><li><a href="/tags/india’s-notebook/">India’s notebook (16)</a></li><li><a href="/tags/miles’-files/">Miles’ files (4)</a></li><li><a href="/tags/samadhiblot/">Samadhiblot (3)</a></li></ol></section><section><h3>By Year</h3><ol><li><a href="/2015/">2015 (23)</a></li></ol></section></div></div><div class="copy">&copy; 2015 samadhiBot.
